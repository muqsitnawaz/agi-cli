/**
 * Benchmark for the CLI entry hot path: `checkForUpdates()` (index.ts:755) and
 * `spawnDetachedSync()` (index.ts:1330), both of which run on EVERY ordinary
 * `agents` invocation except pure `--help`/`--version` (index.ts:1319-1331 guards
 * them behind `!helpOrVersionRequested`). The comment at index.ts:51 flags this
 * same pair as the reason the secrets-broker sync commands are intercepted
 * above commander registration, before `checkForUpdates()`/`spawnDetachedSync()`
 * would otherwise fire on every cache-hit read.
 *
 * `checkForUpdates` (index.ts:755-779) and its helper `maybeWarnMultiInstall`
 * (index.ts:535-575) are NOT exported -- they are private to index.ts, and
 * index.ts cannot be imported directly: it has top-level `await`, reads
 * `process.argv`, and (outside the two early-intercept blocks at index.ts:38 and
 * index.ts:71) eventually calls `program.parse()`, so importing the module as
 * ESM would run the real CLI bootstrap as a side effect of loading this bench
 * file. Instead this benchmarks the exact exported functions `checkForUpdates`
 * calls, with the same real arguments (this machine's real PATH, its real
 * ~/.agents/.cache/.update-check file):
 *
 *   maybeWarnMultiInstall (index.ts:535-575)
 *     -> resolveRunningPackageRoot (self-update.ts:177)
 *     -> findAgentsCliInstalls(process.env.PATH)      (self-update.ts:509)
 *     -> buildMultiInstallInventory(...)              (self-update.ts:401)
 *   checkForUpdates body (index.ts:755-779)
 *     -> readUpdateCache(UPDATE_CHECK_FILE)           (self-update.ts:79)
 *     -> shouldFetchLatest(cache)                     (index.ts:578, PRIVATE -- see note below)
 *     -> shouldPromptUpgrade(cache, VERSION)           (self-update.ts:128)
 *
 * `shouldFetchLatest` (index.ts:578) is itself private to index.ts (not
 * self-update.ts, despite living right beside the exported update-cache
 * helpers there) -- it is NOT benched directly for the same reason
 * `checkForUpdates` itself isn't: nothing can import it without importing all
 * of index.ts. It is one pure comparison (`Date.now() - cache.lastCheck >
 * UPDATE_CHECK_INTERVAL_MS`), immaterial next to the real fs/PATH work
 * measured below -- readUpdateCache's real fs.readFileSync + JSON.parse
 * dominates it by construction, and readUpdateCache is exported and benched.
 *
 * `refreshUpdateCacheInBackground` (index.ts:739-752) and the interactive
 * `promptUpgrade` path are NOT benched: the former is a fire-and-forget network
 * fetch (`fetch(...).then(...)`, never awaited by the caller) and the latter is
 * an interactive TTY prompt -- neither is on the synchronous hot path this file
 * measures, and neither fires on a plain terminal `agents <cmd>` run against a
 * fresh cache.
 *
 * `spawnDetachedSync` (auto-pull.ts:46-72) IS exported and is benched directly,
 * but with one twist: it resolves its worker script relative to
 * `fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)` (auto-pull.ts:51), i.e. relative to wherever
 * the RUNNING copy of this module lives. Importing it the normal bench way (via
 * './auto-pull.js', vitest's TS-source resolution) would put that module at
 * src/lib/auto-pull.ts, where only auto-pull-worker.TS exists -- so
 * `fs.existsSync(workerPath)` (auto-pull.ts:53) would ALWAYS be false and the
 * function would always take the early-return guard path, never actually
 * spawning anything. That is real behavior for an unbuilt checkout, but it is
 * not what a real user's installed copy does (npm ships dist/lib/auto-pull-
 * worker.js). To measure the real spawn this file imports the ACTUAL BUILT
 * ARTIFACT at ../../dist/lib/auto-pull.js (produced by `bun run build` /
 * `bun install`'s `prepare` hook) so `import.meta.url` resolves inside dist/lib/
 * and the real dist/lib/auto-pull-worker.js is found. Both regimes are benched
 * explicitly below so the guard-path cost and the real fork+exec cost are never
 * conflated.
 *
 * No mocking: every call below hits the real filesystem (real PATH, real
 * ~/.agents/.cache files) and, in the "real spawn" group, a real
 * child_process.spawn of the real dist/lib/auto-pull-worker.js -- which itself
 * does a real `git fetch` against this machine's real ~/.agents repos in the
 * background (detached, unref'd, so it does not block this process or this
 * benchmark's timing; see auto-pull-worker.ts). That group is therefore bounded
 * to a small iteration count, mirroring exec.bench.ts's execAgent group.
 *
 * Lives at src/lib/index.bench.ts, not src/index.bench.ts, so that
 * `typecheck:bench` (package.json:58, globs `src/lib/*.bench.ts
 * src/lib/**\/*.bench.ts`) actually type-checks it -- a prior version at
 * src/index.bench.ts silently sat outside that glob and shipped a stale
 * `@ts-expect-error` (TS2578, unused directive) that no gate caught.

/**
 * ============================================================================
 * Command registration hot path: registerEagerForRequest / COMMAND_LOADERS
 * (index.ts:1007-1063, lib/startup/command-registry.ts) and the
 * program.parseAsync() call it feeds (index.ts:1440).
 *
 * Every ordinary `agents <cmd>` invocation resolves `requestedCommand` from
 * argv (index.ts:1232), looks it up in COMMAND_LOADERS
 * (command-registry.ts:155-274), dynamically imports the one-or-two command
 * modules that name maps to, and calls the returned registrar(program)
 * (index.ts:1010-1012 `reg`) BEFORE program.parseAsync() ever runs
 * (index.ts:1440) -- unconditionally, regardless of `--help`/`--version`
 * (index.ts:1271-1280 has no helpOrVersionRequested guard). An unrecognized
 * top-level name (typo, or the brand-disabled path) instead falls back to
 * registerAllEagerCommands() (index.ts:1072-1161), which imports and
 * registers EVERY command module in the CLI so the Levenshtein "did you mean"
 * spellcheck (index.ts:1184-1226) has the full candidate set.
 *
 * index.ts cannot be imported directly (see the docblock at the top of this
 * file -- top-level await, process.argv reads, eventual program.parse()), and
 * neither `reg` nor `registerEagerForRequest` nor `registerAllEagerCommands`
 * is exported, so there is no way to call them in-process without duplicating
 * their dispatch/ordering logic -- exactly the real coupling command-
 * registry.ts's own docblock (command-registry.ts:141-153) says not to
 * re-derive. Two complementary regimes are benched instead:
 *
 *   1. REAL SPAWNED PROCESS (below): `spawnSync` the actual built
 *      dist/index.js with a handful of representative top-level names, each a
 *      fresh Node process -- i.e. a genuinely COLD run of the entire dispatch
 *      path above, exactly as a user's shell invokes it. `--help` is appended
 *      to every invocation so each run exits fast and deterministically
 *      (commander prints help and exits 0) without touching stdin. `--help`
 *      does skip checkForUpdates/spawnDetachedSync (benched above) and
 *      ensureInitialized/runMigration (index.ts:1373-1381, both DO carry a
 *      `!helpOrVersionRequested` guard -- the sibling migration-triad bench in
 *      PR #2277 covers that path), so this isolates the registration/import
 *      cost from those other two hot-path pieces instead of conflating them.
 *   2. WARM IN-PROCESS REGISTRATION (further below): call the real, exported
 *      command-registry.ts loaders directly -- `(await loadX())(new
 *      Command())` -- for a representative subset. Node's ESM loader caches a
 *      module after its first import in this process, so after the first
 *      sample every further call pays ONLY the registrar function's own
 *      synchronous commander-construction work (.command/.option/.action
 *      calls), not disk read + parse + top-level module evaluation. Compared
 *      against group 1's real cold-process numbers for the SAME command, the
 *      gap approximates how much of the real-world cost is "importing the
 *      module and its dependency graph" versus "building the commander
 *      command tree" -- the same decomposition PR #2277 used to show
 *      ensureInitialized's hot-path body is a single syscall dwarfed by its
 *      eager unconditional import.
 *
 * No mocking: group 1 runs the real built dist/index.js against this
 * machine's real ~/.agents (same real filesystem/PATH every other group in
 * this file uses); group 2 calls the real, unmodified command registrars
 * exported from command-registry.ts.

 * ============================================================================
 * Eager self-update IMPORT GRAPH — cold module-evaluation cost (index.ts:86-95).
 *
 * The groups above bench the RUNTIME cost of the functions checkForUpdates
 * calls. This group benches a different, earlier cost: the one-time
 * module-EVALUATION of the `import { ... } from './self-update.js'` statement
 * at index.ts:86-95, which ESM hoists and runs on EVERY `agents` invocation
 * before command registration -- including the `--version`/`--help` fast paths
 * that skip checkForUpdates/spawnDetachedSync entirely (index.ts:114-118 sets
 * only env; the checkForUpdates/spawnDetachedSync guards live at the parse site,
 * but the self-update MODULE body still evaluates unconditionally because the
 * import is static, not dynamic like the COMMAND_LOADERS thunks at index.ts:124).
 *
 * self-update.ts's own body is tiny, but its static `import { compareVersions }
 * from './versions.js'` (self-update.ts:20 -- the binding is used once, at
 * self-update.ts:132) drags the ENTIRE versions.ts dependency graph onto the
 * eager path: versions.ts statically imports yaml, chalk, smol-toml,
 * @inquirer/prompts and ~40 local modules (state, resources, agents,
 * permissions, mcp, plugins, hooks, staleness, ...) at versions.ts:17-68. That
 * is the "versions.ts reaches the eager graph by two edges (~94ms)" cost tracked
 * in RUSH-2331; the self-update.ts:20 import is one of those two edges.
 * self-update.ts's OTHER local import, needsWindowsShell from './platform/
 * index.js' (self-update.ts:21), is a zero-import leaf (platform/index.ts has no
 * imports; IS_WINDOWS = process.platform === 'win32' at platform/index.ts:15),
 * benched below to show it is not the cost.
 *
 * compareVersions is defined in the zero-dependency leaf ./agent-spec/
 * primitives.ts (primitives.ts:50, docblock "zero dependencies") and merely
 * RE-EXPORTED by versions.ts (versions.ts:34 imports it from primitives;
 * versions.ts:2327-2328 re-exports it "so existing `import { compareVersions }
 * from './versions.js'` sites keep working"). So the compareVersions self-update
 * calls is byte-for-byte the same function whether reached via versions.js or
 * primitives.js -- primitives.js is benched below as the proposed replacement
 * source, and the delta versions.js MINUS primitives.js is the measured cost of
 * the heavy edge that swapping self-update.ts:20 would remove.
 *
 * MEASUREMENT REGIME: each module is imported in a FRESH `node` child process
 * (spawnSync, --input-type=module, a bare `await import(<file url>)`), because
 * Node caches an ESM module after its first import IN THIS PROCESS -- and this
 * bench file already statically imports self-update.js at its top, so an
 * in-process dynamic import would measure a warm cache (~0), not the real cold
 * cost a user's shell pays on a fresh `agents` process. Spawning the real built
 * dist/lib/*.js (produced by `bun run build`; NOT the TS source, which Node
 * cannot import without a loader) mirrors exactly how the installed CLI pays
 * this: one cold node process, one cold module graph, per invocation. Every
 * number therefore includes node's ~14ms process-startup floor -- the `bare
 * node, imports nothing` baseline below measures that floor so the module-graph
 * cost is read as (module MINUS bare), not the raw number. No mocking: real
 * child processes, real built artifacts, real filesystem.
 *
 * Bounded iteration counts (each spawn is a real fork+exec of node, ~15-110ms),
 * mirroring the real-cold-process groups earlier in this file.
